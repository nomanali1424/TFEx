the surrounding area. The data is taken from Northern California
Earthquake Data Center and each data is an averaged
reading for one hour, with the first reading taken on Dec 1st 1967,
the last in 2003. We transform this single time series into a
classification problem by first defining a major event as any
reading of over 5 on the Rictor scale. Major events are often
followed by aftershocks. The physics of these are well understood
and their detection is not the objective of this exercise. Hence we
consider a positive case to be one where a major event is not
preceded by another major event for at least 512 hours. To
construct a negative case, we consider instances where there is a
reading below 4 (to avoid blurring of the boundaries between major
and non major events) that is preceded by at least 20 readings in
the previous 512 hours that are non-zero (to avoid trivial negative
cases). None of the cases overlap in time (i.e. we perform a
segmentation rather than use a sliding window). Of the 86,066
hourly readings, we produce 368 negative cases and 93 positive.

vertebrates, found within the sacculus of the pars inferior. There
are three types of otoliths: sagittae, lapilli, and asterisci. In
fish, it is primarily the sagittal otoliths that are studied, as
they are larger and easier to prepare and observe. Otoliths vary
markedly in shape and size between species, but are of similar
shape to other stocks of the same species. Otoliths contain
information that can be used by `expert readers' to determine
several key factors important in managing fish stock. Analysis of
otolith boundaries may allow estimation of stock composition,
including whether the samples are from one stock or multiple
stocks, allowing management decisions to be made}. This data

CG Positive: Initial Return Stroke

A positive charge is lowered from a cloud to the ground. The
characteristic feature of this type of event in the power density
time series is a sharp turn-on of radiation, followed by a few
hundreds of microseconds of noise.

IR Negative Initial Return Stroke

A negative charge is lowered from a cloud to ground. The power
waveform slowly ramps up to a level known as an attachment point,
where a large surge current causes the VHF power to 'spike'. This
attachment is followed by an exponentially shaped decline in the
waveform.

SR Subsequent Negative Return Stroke

A negative charge is lowered from a cloud to ground. As the name
implies, subsequent return strokes come after initial return
strokes. Note that subsequent positive return strokes don't exist.

I Impulsive Event

Typically an intra-cloud event characterized by a sudden peak in
the waveform.

I2 Impulsive Event Pair

Another intra-cloud event characterized by sudden peaks in the
waveform that come in closely separated pairs. These are also
called TIPPs (Trans-Ionospheric Pulse Pairs).

KM Gradual Intra-Cloud Stroke

An intra-cloud event which increases in power more gradually than
an impulsive event.

O Off-record

800 microseconds was not enough to fully capture the lightning
event.

The three problems {\em DistalPhalanxOutlineAgeGroup, MiddlePhalanxOutlineAgeGroup and ProximalPhalanxOutlineAgeGroup} involve using the outline of one of the phalanges to predict whether the subject is one of three age groups: 0-6 years old, 7-12 years old and 13-19 years old. Note that these problems are aligned by subject, and hence can be treated as a multi dimensional TSC problem. Problem Phalanges contains the concatenation of all three problems. Bone age estimation is usually performed by an expert with an algorithm called Tanner-Whitehouse. This involves scoring each bone into one of seven categories based on the stage of development. The final three bone image classification problems, DistalPhalanxTW, MiddlePhalanxTW and ProximalPhalanxTW}, involve predicting the Tanner-Whitehouse score (as labelled by a human expert) from the outline.",https://www.uea.ac.uk/computing/machine-learning/predictive-modelling-of-bone-ageing,http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4781,,0000-00-00 00:00:00,0,1
